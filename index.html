        <p>The Taj Mahal is an iconic symbol of love and architectural wonder located in Agra, India.
             Commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz
              Mahal, it took over 20,000 artisans and craftsmen to complete the construction, which lasted 
              for around 22 years. The Taj Mahal is renowned for its stunning white marble facade adorned with
               intricate inlay work, including semi-precious stones and intricate calligraphy from the Quran. 
               It stands as a testament to the beauty of Mughal architecture and remains one of the most visited
                landmarks in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year. <br><br/>  The Taj Mahal's architectural
                 design is a remarkable blend of Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles, showcasing the pinnacle
                  of Mughal architecture. The main structure consists of a symmetrical layout with a central
                   white marble mausoleum flanked by four minarets standing at each corner. The mausoleum houses
                    the tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, while the surrounding complex includes beautifully
                     landscaped gardens, reflecting pools, and additional structures such as a mosque and a guesthouse.<br><br/>

                The intricate details of the Taj Mahal's exterior are awe-inspiring. The marble surfaces are adorned with
                 delicate floral motifs, geometric patterns, and calligraphy, showcasing the skill of the craftsmen who
                  worked on it. The use of translucent marble allows light to filter through, creating a mesmerizing play
                   of light and shadow throughout the day. <br><br/>
                
                The Taj Mahal's significance extends beyond its architectural beauty. It is a symbol of enduring love and devotion,
                 as Shah Jahan built it as a tribute to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. 
                 The mausoleum's design and the materials used, including the white marble and precious gemstones, 
                 reflect the emperor's profound grief and his desire to create a lasting monument to their love. <br><br/>
                
                Over the centuries, the Taj Mahal has become not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site but also a universally 
                recognized symbol of India's rich cultural heritage. Its timeless elegance and emotional resonance continue
                 to captivate visitors from around the world, making it one of the most cherished and photographed landmarks
                  on the planet. </p>
